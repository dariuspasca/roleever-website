Before we begin, we want to ask players to agree to the terms below. We encourage everyone to read the full document; we hope it will be useful for you to calibrate the type of community we want to create together in RoleEver. Remember that this code of conduct is a supplement to the [Terms and Conditions](https://roleever.com/tos), which you must accept before you can access any of our services.

### COMMIT TO RESPECT AND EMPATHY

We ask you to treat others with dignity and respect. Show empathy and try to build trust with other players.

We ask and expect that:

- Pay attention to how you express yourself. If you've just met, don't assume everyone understands your ways. If someone asks you not to use a certain word, don't use it, even if you personally don't find it offensive.

- Never use offensive or aggressive language. We do not tolerate derogatory comments about a player's gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, mental or physical ability, religion or country of origin.

- Don't make jokes about people. Be respectful of the sensitivity of others.

- Do not launch threats of any kind.

- Don't expect anyone to have to "put up with" your language. If you have bothered someone, accept them and behave better next time. Respect people's limits.

- Avoid posting, broadcasting or sharing advertisements, solicitations, "spam", illegal or unauthorised content.

- Do not post or broadcast any content that is obscene, pornographic, abusive, offensive, profane or otherwise violates any third party law or right or content that contains homophobia, ethnic slurs, religious intolerance, or encourages criminal conduct

### PROTECT YOUR COMMUNITY

Help build the ideal community you would like to be a part of. Use common sense and the tools at your disposal to protect yourself and other players, and support them when they need help.

We ask and expect that:

- If someone is harassing a player, speak up if you’re able. Take care not to make the situation worse, but sometimes a little support can mean a lot to your teammate.

- Help maintain a positive environment; if you have witnessed or think that someone is committing an infringement, report it to us and we will take care of it.

- Don’t call for mass reports or pull teammates into an argument. One report is enough to let us know something’s happening.

### CONSEQUENCES

If you violate the expectations described here, we may restrict your privileges or access to features in RoleEver.
